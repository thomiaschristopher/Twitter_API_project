# Description

I discovered in a Kaggle topic the "sentiment analysis" about the vaccination (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/explore-vaccines-tweets/notebook)
and I decided do the same think on the Netflix's serie Arcane.

Firstly, I would scrap all the tweets between the first and the last episode but finally I just do the analysis on the last 30k tweets on the 02/12/2021.

## Scrapping 

I used the twitter API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and tweepy to get the 30k Tweets.
