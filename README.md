# Description

I discovered in a Kaggle topic the "sentiment analysis" about the vaccination (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/explore-vaccines-tweets/notebook)
and I decided do the same thing on the Netflix's serie Arcane.

Firstly, I would have liked to take all the tweets between the first and the last episode but finally I did the analysis on the last 30k tweets on the 02/12/2021.
(Twitter API was asking so much information to get the elevation it needed to the first case).

## Scrapping 

I used the twitter API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and tweepy to get the 30k Tweets.
You need to get your API key and token thanks to it :
